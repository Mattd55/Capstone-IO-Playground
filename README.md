# STEM Playground

An interactive IoT educational platform designed to teach integrated systems concepts to grades 6-12 students through hands-on experimentation with sensors, actuators, and real-time web interfaces.

## Overview

The STEM Playground is a complete educational system built around the ESP32 microcontroller that demonstrates how voltage drives integrated systems. Students interact with various sensors and outputs through a custom web interface, learning fundamental engineering concepts in an engaging, hands-on environment.

## Features

- **Real-time Web Interface**: Custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application with bidirectional WebSocket communication
- **Multi-Sensor Integration**: Temperature probes, pressure sensors, buttons, switches, and multiple I/O devices
- **Interactive Outputs**: LEDs, servo motors, DC motors with speed control
- **Wireless Connectivity**: ESP32-hosted web server accessible from any device
- **Custom PCB Design**: Professional circuit board for reliable connections and easy assembly
- **Rechargeable Power System**: Lithium-ion battery pack with 27+ hour runtime
- **Educational Resources**: Complete lesson plans and user documentation
